# problem 1.1

## c

When a is not equal to b, the square s^2 measures the "empty space" left within the c^2 square.

When a is equal to b, there is no square, and rearranging the triangles in step 2 results in a rectangle, a * 2a, which is equal to a^2 + a^2, which in this case is equal to a^2 + b^2.

Because the method works in both cases (a equals b, a does not equal b), and no other cases are possible in euclidean geometry for right triangles, no contradiction is possible.

## d

* sum of a triangle's angles is 180 degrees
* squares have equal sides
* right triangles have exactly one angle equal to 90 degrees
* each angle in a square is equal to 90 degrees

# problem 1.2

## a

This step is incorrect:

```
sqrt((-1) * (-1)) = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1)
```

On the left side of the equation, you multiply first before you apply the `sqrt` operation, so you end up calling `sqrt(1)`, which simplifies to 1.

However, on the right side of the equation, `sqrt(-1)` yields not 1, but the imaginary number i. i^2 equals -1, not 1.

## b

If 1 = -1, then 2 = 1.

Proof. Assume 1 = -1.

Applying the same operation to both sides of a valid equation yields another valid equation. Therefore, we can divide both sides by 2, to see that

```
1/2 = -1/2
```

Following the same logic, we can add 3/2 to both sides of the equation

```
4/2 = 2/2
```

Simplifying the fractions to integers yields the equation

```
2 = 1
```

QED.

## c

```
sqrt(r * s) = sqrt(r) * sqrt(s)
```

Proof.

By definition, for any non-negative real number n, `n = sqrt(n) * sqrt(n)`

Therefore,
```
r * s = sqrt(r*s) * sqrt(r*s)
```

For any equation, applying the same operation to both sides yields another equation. So, we can multiply both sides by `sqrt(r * s)`

Therefore,

```
sqrt(r * s) = sqrt(r) * sqrt(s)
```

implies

```
r * s = sqrt(r) * sqrt(s) * sqrt(r * s)
```

For any three four terms a, b, c and d

```
if

a = b * c

and

a = b * d

it implies that

c = d
```

Therefore, because we already know that

```
r * s = sqrt(r * s) * sqrt(r * s)
and
r * s = sqrt(r * s) * sqrt(r) * sqrt(s)
```

We know that `sqrt(r * s) = sqrt(r) * sqrt(s)`.

QED.

# Problem 1.3

## a

The second deduction is incorrect.

```
3 * log10(1/2) > 2 log10(1/2)
```

This would only hold if log10(1/2) was positive, but it is negative, so in fact

```
3 * log10(1/2) < 2 log10(1/2)
```

## b

The third deduction is illegal. Fractional currency is an accounting convenience, we should not be mislead into thinking we can multiply currency amounts with each other as if they were real numbers. It's more useful to think of currency in terms of its smallest unit, in the American case the penny. In this case:

1 = 1 = 10^2 is clearly wrong.

## c

I'm not sure exactly where the problem here is...the equalities are true because a-b is by definition 0, and multiplying anything by 0 gets 0, which I think is close to the heart of the problem.

Anyway, step 5 violates an axiom of mathematics - it's not true that a + b = b for any two equal real numbers.
