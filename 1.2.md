# problem 2.1

Let C by the set of counterexamples to 2.2, namely

C ::= {n|...}

C is the set of postage amounts, assembled using only 10 and 15 cent stamps, that are not divisible by 5.

Assume for the purposes of obtaining a contradiction that C is nonempty. Then by the WOP, there is a smallest number `m` in `C`. This m must be positive because it must be at least 10 or 15, by definition (it must be comprised of at least one 10 or 15 cent stamp).

But if `S(m)` holds and m is positive, then `S(m-10)` or `S(m-15)` must hold, because 10 cents and 15 cents are not members of `C`, and all `n` for which `S(n)` hold are sums of 10 and 15 cent stamps. So subtracting a stamp from `m` must result in a positive number, equal to at least 10 or 15, which is another sum of stamps. Therefore, one of `S(m-10)` or `S(m-15)` must hold.

So suppose that `S(m-10)` holds. Then `5 | (m - 10)`, because we know that `(m-10)` is a positive number, and a sum of stamps. Because any constituent stamp can be divided by 5, the sum of any series of stamps can be divided by 5.

But if `5 | (m-10)` then obviously `5 | m`, contradicting the fact that `m` is a counterexample.

Next if `S(m-15)` holds, we arrive at a contradiction in the same way.

Since we get a contradiction in both cases, we conclude that there is no smallest element in C. Then, by the WOP, C is empty, that is there are no counterexamples to 2.2.

Which proves that 2.2 holds. QED

# problem 2.2

line 8 is a logical error - `F(m-2)` is not necessarily a member of the set of Fibonnaci numbers. In particular, F(-1) is not defined. (not sure if this is the right term)

# problem 2.3

There must be a smallest rational, q0 in C. Since q0/2 < q0, it must be possible to express q0/2 in lowest terms, namely

q0/2 = m/n for positive integers m,n with no common prime factor.

I can't find an obvious problem with this one.

Suspect bits:

the above, the reasoning in the two cases.

Ah, the problem I think is q0/2, and then using ratio rules. q0/2 isn't a valid ratio, because q0 isn't necessarily an integer. I'm not sure that dividing a rational number by 2 always produces a rational number...but I'm hazy here.
